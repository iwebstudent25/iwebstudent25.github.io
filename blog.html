            <h3>Week 2</h3>
            <div class="date">June 21, 2019</div>
            <p>This week, i started to personalize my website with more CSS. I also created my subpages: About and Blog.
                I also am thinking of adding another subpage sometime soon and maybe put some writing there. I created
                my lists in the about page and the blogs you are reading now. I think the hardest part was adding all
                the links to the About page using HTML. Considering that this was a mainly CSS-based week, I used a
                surprisingly large amount of HTML work to make my website have more content. I finished my lists this
                week and added more color to the website. Now, instead of just having pink and green as my colors, I
                added a color called "Rebecca Purple" for my font (if my lovely friend, Becky is reading this, I chose
                this color for you!). I also made a header and footer for my website, which
                makes it easy to go from page to page in my website. </p>
            <h3>Week 1</h3>
            <div class="date">June 14, 2019</div>
            <p>This week, I created the very start of my website. I started off with very little knowledge about coding
                and ended up with a live, working website. I was able to try out the basics of HTML and CSS for the
                first time. I started by making a readme on github and synced my work into VS code. I created my main
                homepage. I learned the basics of how to make an unordered list and an ordered list and created the
                favorites lists on my homepage. A lot of this week was just setting up and getting used to writing
                different types of code. Out of everything I learned and tried in this first week, I enjoyed learning
                and starting to try CSS the most. We actually had to do the CSS twice because the first time we did the
                CSS as part of the HTML file. The second time, we gave the CSS its own file. At the end of the week, I
                ended up with a one-page, green and pink gradient website. </p>
