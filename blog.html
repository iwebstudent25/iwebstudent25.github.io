                <h3>Week 6</h3>
                <div class="date">July 19, 2019</div>
                <p>This week is the very last week of summer school! Personally, I'm pretty happy with how it went, but
                    it's sad that it's all over already. I know I said this for the past few weeks, but I really mean it
                    this time. This week has to have been the easist, most relaxed week so far. We had half a class of
                    free time every day! We mainly did some minor edits on our websites and finished off anything we
                    hadn't completed. I also got to look at my contrast and check that my html and css worked well and
                    was accurate using a few checking websites. I also had the opportunity to submit an adobe XD
                    prototype to one of the contests we had in class. The last thing we did this week, and in this
                    course, was an awards ceremony and a short review on what we did in the past six weeks and how to do
                    it again if we ever want to create another website in the future. </p>

                <h3>Week 5</h3>
                <div class="date">July 12, 2019</div>
                <p>This week was very fun. We mainly worked on Adobe XD making custom UI designs. I added some of my UI
                    designs onto my website homepage using Fancybox 3 as a lesson of Design patterns. I also got to
                    finish spacing my Escape! novella using h4s. I also created a few logos that I may use for my
                    website and took some pictures that I may use for my home page hero. This week, in comparison to the
                    last few weeks, was pretty easy and simple, as well as a lot of fun, since we were mainly focused on
                    customization.</p>

                <h3>Week 4</h3>
                <div class="date">July 5, 2019</div>
                <p>This week was pretty laid back and fun. We mainly edited our adobe XD prototypes. I thought this week
                    was
                    especially fun because it was almost like using CSS in the sense that it was just customization but
                    it
                    was much easier. I got to make my own impossible quiz on my XD file, which was pretty fun. It was
                    like
                    the quizzes I would make with Reece on notability but this one is actually programmed to work with
                    clicking. A few of my friends beat the quiz and "outsmarted Deli-Aisle" after trying for a while. It
                    was
                    really fun to create it since it was really easy and a nice way to see the kind of variety of things
                    you
                    can do with Adobe XD. I created the quiz by making subpages with questions and linking them each to
                    the
                    next question. Every wrong answer was linked to a YOU LOSE! page.

                <h3>Week 3</h3>
                <div class="date">June 28, 2019</div>
                <p>This week, we focused on adobe. I started editing images in photoshop and then went on to edit a
                    summer
                    logo I created in adobe illustrstor. I also got to try to create many customizable web page
                    prototypes
                    in Adobe XD. One of my favorites was the creepy turtle, haha. I also made one with a pig and a bird.
                    I
                    thought it was fun to try different designs with my website.</p>

                <h3>Week 2</h3>
                <div class="date">June 21, 2019</div>
                <p>This week, i started to personalize my website with more CSS. I also created my subpages: About and
                    Blog.
                    I also am thinking of adding another subpage sometime soon and maybe put some writing there. I
                    created
                    my lists in the about page and the blogs you are reading now. I think the hardest part was adding
                    all
                    the links to the About page using HTML. Considering that this was a mainly CSS-based week, I used a
                    surprisingly large amount of HTML work to make my website have more content. I finished my lists
                    this
                    week and added more color to the website. Now, instead of just having pink and green as my colors, I
                    added a color called "Rebecca Purple" for my font (if my lovely friend, Becky is reading this, I
                    chose
                    this color for you!). I also made a header and footer for my website, which
                    makes it easy to go from page to page in my website. </p>

                <h3>Week 1</h3>
                <div class="date">June 14, 2019</div>
                <p>This week, I created the very start of my website. I started off with very little knowledge about
                    coding
                    and ended up with a live, working website. I was able to try out the basics of HTML and CSS for the
                    first time. I started by making a readme on github and synced my work into VS code. I created my
                    main
                    homepage. I learned the basics of how to make an unordered list and an ordered list and created the
                    favorites lists on my homepage. A lot of this week was just setting up and getting used to writing
                    different types of code. Out of everything I learned and tried in this first week, I enjoyed
                    learning
                    and starting to try CSS the most. We actually had to do the CSS twice because the first time we did
                    the
                    CSS as part of the HTML file. The second time, we gave the CSS its own file. At the end of the week,
                    I
                    ended up with a one-page, green and pink gradient website. </p>
